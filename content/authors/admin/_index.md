My name is Nalin Asanka Gamagedara Arachchilage (too long, isn't it? I admit that this can be confusing sometime). I am a Senior Research Fellow (Level C/6) in Cyber Security (Research Associate Professor in US) within the Department of Computer Science and Information Technology at La Trobe University, Australia, where I currently lead the Usable Security Engineering Research Laboratory (USERLab) in the Optus La Trobe Cyber Security Research Hub. Previously, I was a Lecturer in Cyber Security in the School of Engineering and Information Technology of the University of New South Wales at the Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA), where I led the Usable Security research group. Apart from my teaching at UNSW, I also researched in the area of usable security and privacy (i.e. designing secure (and also privacy) systems that people can use) and supervised postdoctoral researchers and postgraduate students (PhD/MPhil) with refereed publications and thesis.
