abstract: Games can be used to support learning and confidence development in several domains, including the secure use of computers. However, emphasizing different types of knowledge in a game design can lead to different outcomes. This study explores two game designs that aim to enhance students' ability to identify phishing hyperlinks. One design focuses on procedural knowledge; developing students' tacit ability to recognize phishing hyperlinks through systematic practice. The other design focuses on conceptual knowledge; helping students to explicitly reflect upon and identify the features of phishing hyperlinks. The results of a double-blind randomized trial with 66 participants suggests that using a game designed for conceptual knowledge leads to a greater increase in learners' ability to identify phishing hyperlinks. Hence, incorporating conceptual knowledge development into educational games enhances their efficacy within the computer security context.
